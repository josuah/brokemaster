|Note to readers: After you apply this patch, your queue will no longer
|be readable in its current state.  So, either install this into
|/var/qmail2 and run both qmails until the queue is emptied on the old
|one, or else accept that your current queue will have to be destroyed
|and ``rm -rf /var/qmail/queue; make setup''.

|Subject: Missing piece of your big-todo patch
|Date: Tue, 3 Aug 1999 08:12:11 -0600

|Greetings.
|
|While testing the performance of a big todo directory, I observed that
|qmail-qstat miscounted the number of messages in the todo directory.
|I've appended the necessary patch to yours.
